# TOML parser in Zig programming language

This is a parser of [TOML](https://toml.io/) language for [Zig programming
language](https://ziglang.org/).

This will be based on [toml-1.0.0r2 spec](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.1).

Currently it does not support date/time data types, as Zig does not have these
types in the standard library.
